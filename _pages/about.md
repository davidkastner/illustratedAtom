Illustrated Atom is a personal project that explores the limits of scientific communication and vizualization during my time as a Ph.D. candidate in the Kulik Lab at MIT <a href="http://hjkgrp.mit.edu/">http://hjkgrp.mit.edu/</a>. The goal of the project is to push the frontier of molecular vizualization as I explore my Ph.D. research. I am passionate about showing the public and other scientists the beautiful world of small molecules, proteins, and metalloenzymes.
